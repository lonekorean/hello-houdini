Some demos using Houdini's CSS Paint API.

The CSS Paint API only works over <strong>https</strong> or <strong>localhost</strong>. If you want to play with these demos locally, I recommend [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to easily serve them over <strong>localhost</strong>.

To learn more, please read the tutorial article, [Say Hello to Houdini and the CSS Paint API](https://codersblock.com/blog/say-hello-to-houdini-and-the-css-paint-api/). You can see all of these demos in action on the [Hello Houdini demo site](https://hello-houdini.herokuapp.com/).
